# Credential-Pursuit (made for DeltaHacks 11)
This simple game teaches youth important account security practices.

## Inspiration
I initially wanted to compete in the Auth0 challenge, so they were my initial spark of inspiration hence the login game.

## What it does
This simple game teaches youth important account security practices they can take with them all throughout life.

## How we built it
A lot of ChatGPT, a lot of Stack Overflow, a lot of YouTube, and way too much uninstalling and reinstalling.

## Challenges we ran into
This was my first time doing front-end which was a **big** learning curve for me, as was Git. I have also _ never used an API _ before, or Auth0 so after hours of trying to get my game to integrate with the service, I had to move on to a different idea.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm really glad I tried this! I've never done anything like this before and I've never actually competed in a hackathon! I really stepped outside of my comfort zone this weekend and I definitely learned a lot.

## What we learned
How **NOT** to set up Git, and how to install, then uninstall, then reinstall every application under the sun.

## What's next for Credential Pursuit
I've been wanting to start making content that teaches people of all ages about media literacy and proper online safety practices, so hopefully, I can expand on this and and really help people stay safe online and feel more secure.
